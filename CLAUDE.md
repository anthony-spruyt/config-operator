# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Purpose

This repository is a **GitHub Repository Operator** - a registry and orchestrator that syncs configuration to multiple GitHub repositories to standardize developer experience across projects.

### Related Projects

- **[xfg](https://github.com/anthony-spruyt/xfg)**: The underlying tool used to sync configuration files to target repositories
- **[claude-config](https://github.com/anthony-spruyt/claude-config)**: Repository containing shared Claude configuration (`.claude/` directory contents)

### Goals

- Eliminate repetitive setup when creating new repositories
- Standardize configuration and developer experience across all repositories
- Centralize the distribution of new development experience features
- Reduce hours of manual configuration work

### Authentication

- **Phase 1**: Uses GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) for repository access
- **Phase 2** (planned): Migrate to GitHub App for improved security and permissions

## Architecture

This project is in early development. The architecture will be documented here as the codebase evolves.
